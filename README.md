# 🧬 Blood Cell Classification & Counting App

A Flask web application that allows users to:

- Upload **blood smear images**
- **Count white blood cells** by class (e.g., neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.)
- **Classify individual cells** in cropped images

Built using **Fastai**, **OpenCV**, and **Flask**, this project showcases the use of computer vision in the biomedical domain.

## 🔍 Features

- 🧠 Custom trained Fastai CNN model (MobileNetV2)
- 🧪 Image preprocessing and segmentation using OpenCV
- 🧬 Cell classification into multiple classes (e.g. neutrophil, eosinophil, monocyte...)
- 🌐 Flask-powered web interface
- 🖼️ Upload multiple images for counting or classification
- 📊 Output predictions and cell counts
